      <p>
        I have many different memories from Malakasa Camp, I believe that 12-16 ages are a very important and
        special season for every person, when I entered Malakasa Camp I was 13 years old and when I left
        Malakasa I was 15. I had very difficult times in Malakasa Camp, I experienced many things that a child
        shouldn't, therer were wars and fights every night!
        But my life is not like a normal person, I even bored as a refugee and yet I didn't even
        experience a normal life
      </p>
      <p>
        Ok, let it, I want to speak about Malakasa Camp, not too much about myself, Malakasa Camp was a big
        Camp, there was
        more than 3.000 refugee in the Camp, On the camp, there was half container and half buildings and
        tents, I and my family was living in a container, it was very small for us because we are 6 people,
        But our situation was much better than one's who were in tents, and was using all the same toilet
      </p>
      <p>
        Accessing education was very difficult in Malakasa Camp, I went to the office that was registering for
        school about 90 times, and finally, they registered me for the school but I managed to join school 5
        months later, that was the program of every school year on Malakasa. When I registered for school
        successfully, and after 4 months I managed to join. It was the first day that I was going to attend
        school in Athens city of Greece, I had many expectations, I was thinking that I'm going to attend the
        school like normal children, with other Greek children, but the brought us to a container on a public
        school, all the greek children were in the school building, but refugee children were packed into a
        container at school's yard, We were deeply feeling the discrimination.Accessing to education was very

      </p>
      <p>
        In the Camp we had some classes like Greek, English, Maths, and Guitar, with very kind teachers, The
        lessons in the camp were very interesing for me, opposit of public school. We were very far from the
        city and the only way to go to the city was with train, But nobody had inof mony to use train, and we
        didnt had any other way, we didnt even had peromission to have a job in Greece and work, the only way
        to shop was to go to city, there was not any shop around the camp, and we were using the train without
        paing, I didnt really liked that but we didnt had any other way, we needed food, every time
        thatcheking of the train were asking for ticet, and we didnt had, they were insult us, and they were
        puting us out of the train...
