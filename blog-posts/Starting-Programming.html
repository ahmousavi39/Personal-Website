                <p>
                  In this post, I will try to talk a little about why and how did I enter the programming world,
                  You may not belive it but it started with a movie(Mr. Robot), if you are interested in programming or
                  cybersecurity you may already hear about it,
                  If I would describe the movie in 3 words, I choose INSPIRING, INTERESTING, and HACKING.
                  The movie was about a hacker group, and every character has a special profession and skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I watched that movie, I deeply interested to become a hacker,
                  It became my biggest dream, but it was funny for most people, and because of that I was not sharing my
                  dream with everyone,
                  till when I decided to do something and relays my dream,
                  I knew that I had a long way, but I started, as it was not normal to start learning hacking I decided
                  to first learn basic things about computers,
                  I started with a typing course, I was only trough (<a href='https://typing.com'>typing.com</a>), I
                  continued that lesson, but after 3
                  months it became boring for me,
                  and I started trying to enter the programming world!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I started another online course (Khan Academy), it was about web design and HTML/CSS, It is a really
                  simple part of web designing, but it was not very easy for me when I newly started learning
                  programming,
                  and after 2 months I finished that course and became familiar with HTML/CSS, but I still was not able
                  to talk about my dream, because I was very new to the programming world, and when I was talking about
                  what I learned yet,
                  they were laughing because this was only the simples part of programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After learning HTML/CSS I decided to become a professional in programming, and I started searching for
                  programming courses around me,
                  and I finally found a programming course <a href="https://socialhackersacademy.org">Social Hackers
                    Academy</a>. It was free and for refugees and as I
                  was a refugee a managed to attend their lessons,
                  But it was not easy, the course was 40km far from the camp that I was living on,
                  I was all in English, but my English was very bad,
                  Lessons were at night and I was only 14 years old, and it was very risk full for me,
                  lessons were only for one's who aged more than 16, and the rule was not accepting me to attend the
                  lessons,
                  I didn't have a laptop or PC,
                  But I didn't give up, and I started solving them one by one, I went to their office and explained to
                  them my situation,
                  they were very kind people, they told me that we will accept you, and we have no problem with your
                  age,
                  they told me that I have 3 months to learn English and they gave me a Laptop.
                  And I started attending the lessons.
                </p>

                  </blockquote> -->
                <p>
                  After 8 months, the lessons were finished, and I became like a professional ;)
                  Then I started talking strongly about my dream, and I started WORKING FOR IT!
                  I started attending online classes, this time my target was learning HACKING, not programming, not web
                  designing, not typing, and stuff like that.
                  This time I only focused on hacking, and I started a CEH(Certified Ethical Hacker) course,
                  and I'm continuing the CEH course, and I'm sure that I will realize my dream very sooooooon ....

                  That may be ture, but not for every hacker!
                </p>
                <br />
                <strong>
                  There is 3 kind of hackers :</strong>
                <ol>

                </ol>
                <br />
                <strong>White hat</strong>
                <p>White hat hackers are the good group of hackers,<br />

                  secure their systems...
                </p>
                <br />
                <strong>Gray hat</strong>
                <p>
                  Gray hat hackers are in the middle,<br />
                  they may somethimes do some bad things,<br />
                  but usualy they are not thieves or ...

                <br />
                <strong>Black hat</strong>
                <p>
